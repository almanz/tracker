# tracker


Overview:

This project is designed to keep track of work applications, and document all the jobs that have been applied to.


Description:

The program keeps track of a JSON file which gets manually appended in a certain format each time a new job has been applied to.


As of this writing, it is not so showy, and requires manual inputting to be of use.
